# react-podcast
A podcast app using react18 over node verion 18.4.0


Installation

    Clone the develop branch.

    Run npm install, and make sure that you are using Node version 18.4.0.

    This app uses CORS, so you need to start the proxy-server in order to access the data. To do this, open a new terminal
    in the root of the react-podcast project and type: npm run proxy.

    To run the project in your VSC, open a terminal and type npm run dev. Remember that the previous terminal with the 
    proxy server needs to be running as well.

Enjoy the podcast!
